# Scripts and Stuff for Shepherd

Scripts and stuff to get shepherd to boot as PID1 for void.  Most of this is
written for (and taken from) Void Linux's default init system, runint, and will
eventually^TM^ be rewritten.

## Notes

The following files are taken from [void-runit](https://github.com/void-linux/void-runit).
- [rc.conf](./rc.conf)
- [rc.local](./rc.local)
- [rc.shutdown](./rc.shutdown)
- [seedrng.c](./seedrng.c)
- most of [shepherd-init.sh](./shepherd-init.sh)
